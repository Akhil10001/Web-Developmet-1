            The class I like the most is CS-546. I have always wanted to pursue Web development
            as a career option but I did not know where to start and what technologies should I be
            familiar. But, because of this course I have learned a lot more than I thought I would.
            Now, I have understood how to move forward in web development and make it as my career.

            The most memorable day was attending my first CS-546 lecture, I remember professor Hill
            was explaining about the rules that we have to follow for the class and cracking jokes 
            in between and trying to make us concentrate on the rules and what we are going to learn in the
            semester.

        <h2>PSG College Of Technology</h2>
        <p>
           I thoroughly enjoyed my Algorithms class, I think it is because the professor was very good at 
           explaining complicated problems in a simple manner. I have learnt a lot from his classes and
           it was fun and essential part of the programming.

          The most memorable day was when I met my classmates during my first class. We went to a restaurant and 
          to a movie, although the movie was really bad. I remember having loads of fun with them on the first day. 
          I still rememeber all the incidents that happened that day as if it was yesterday.
