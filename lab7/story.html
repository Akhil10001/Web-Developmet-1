        Recently a favorite actor of mine has passed away suddenly. He was extremely fit and a very positive person.
        He died of a heart attack at his house during a workout session. If you saw him in life, 
        you would not think he would die of a heart attack, but it all happened in a minute.

        I have realized that life is too short to live without happiness. We really cannot predict when we will die.
        I have also learned that I should thank everyone who helped me to be whatever I am today and tell 
        the people I love the most that I will always love them no matter what. 
        I have been thinking about how I want to live my life and how I want to leave the earth.
